Classes are a way to organize complex data, fields are easy and simple ways to do this.
Fields are basically variables that belong to that classes
The blue and green things after public or private are fields, they are mostly "int", "bool" or "float".
If private is used, the object won't be able to be accessed on unity by us. 
If public is used, the object will be able to be accessed on  unity by is.

I couldn't destroy the door in my game so I asked Albert for help but he didn't really. Albert told me that there were 2 ways and I thought one was too hard so I thought of another one but forgot how to do it so he told me to search it up on google(he had to use his big brain to make me write this).
I searched it up on google and found the answer(how to find a specific game object in unity).
I was being stupid and made the game object called hand instead of door.

GameObject.Find

Making a variable with a public scope then adding the game object through unity.

gameObject is not a function
hover over words to answer Albert's questions
void is return type
